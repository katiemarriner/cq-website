# Capitol Quest

The marketing website and prototype for Capitol Quest, a product pitch for Reese News Lab.

Capitol Quest is a mobile game where the player, a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, can vote on bills. The simulation will model current bills discussed in the assembly. Legislators can make backroom deals to make their way to the top by garnering votes to pass bills.
